# Alias

Team work project with two more junior developers. A clone of the Alias app created on Storyboards. Contains 4 screens: the start screen, description screen with rules, the main screen and the result screen.
Implemented switching to the result screen after 60 seconds, displaying a joke via api and counting the final score.
